## What is Azitoth?

[Azitoth](https://azitoth.com) is a Minecraft server. It is loving owned and operated by the Azitoth core members. This organization houses various repositories that we use to administer our server to our audience!

## What makes Azitoth different?

We set out to make a Minecraft server that isn't quite like the rest. Since a lot of the core members have a background in software engineering, we decided to use our skills to create something we thought could truly special. Come take a look for yourself!
